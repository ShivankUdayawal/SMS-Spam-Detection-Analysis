# SMS-Spam-Detection-Analysis

### Build a prediction model that will accurately classify which texts are spam?

#### Introduction :

The growth of mobile phone users has lead to a dramatic increasing of SMS spam messages. In practice, fighting mobile phone spam is difficult by several factors, including the lower rate of SMS that has allowed many users and service providers to ignore the issue, and the limited availability of mobile phone spam-filtering software. On the other hand, in academic settings, a major handicap is the scarcity of public SMS spam datasets, that are sorely needed for validation and comparison of different classifiers. Moreover, as SMS messages are fairly short, content-based spam filters may have their performance degraded.

We all know that the internet and social media have become the quickest and most straightforward ways to get information. As a result, messages have become a significant source of information. In this era, Short message service or SMS is one of the most potent means of communication. As the dependence on mobile devices has drastically increased over the period, it has led to increased muggings via SMS. We can now extract meaningful information from such data using various artificial intelligence techniques thanks to technological advancements.
